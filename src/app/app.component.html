            a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting, remaining
            essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem
            Ipsum passages, and
            more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum</p>
